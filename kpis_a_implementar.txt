🏦 Revenue & Growth

	MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) → total subscription revenue per month.

	ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) → MRR × 12.

	New MRR → revenue from brand new customers.

	Expansion MRR → upsells / add-ons / seat increases.

	Contraction MRR → downgrades / reduced usage.

	Churned MRR → lost revenue from cancellations.

	Net New MRR = New + Expansion − Contraction − Churn.

	Growth Rate → % change in MRR month-over-month.

👥 Customer Metrics

	Active Customers → count of distinct customers per month.

	New Customers → count of signups.

	Churned Customers (Logo Churn) → customers who left in a month.

	Customer Churn Rate = churned / active previous month.

	Average Revenue per Account (ARPA) = MRR / # active customers.

	Customer Lifetime (months) = 1 / churn rate.

💰 Value Metrics

	LTV (Customer Lifetime Value) = ARPA × Gross Margin ÷ Churn Rate.

	CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) = spend ÷ conversions.

	CAC by Channel (from events_marketing.csv).

	LTV/CAC Ratio (efficiency benchmark, >3 = healthy).

	Payback Period = CAC ÷ ARPA (months to recover acquisition cost).

📈 Retention & Cohorts

	Cohort Retention → survival of customers grouped by signup month.

	Revenue Retention:

	Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) = 1 − (churned + contraction) ÷ starting MRR.

	Net Revenue Retention (NRR) = (starting MRR − churn + expansion) ÷ starting MRR.

	Logo Retention = % of customers still active from a cohort.

📊 Funnel & Marketing

	Visits → Trials Conversion Rate = trials ÷ visits.

	Trials → Paid Conversion Rate = conversions ÷ trials.

	Overall Funnel Conversion Rate = conversions ÷ visits.

	Spend per Channel (Google, LinkedIn, Organic, Referral).

	ROI per Channel = (MRR from converted customers − spend) ÷ spend.

🌍 Segmentation

	Using customers.csv:

	MRR by Plan (Basic, Pro, Enterprise).

	MRR by Country.

	MRR by Acquisition Channel.

	Churn by Segment (are Enterprise customers more loyal?).
